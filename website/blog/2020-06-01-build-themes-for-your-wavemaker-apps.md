Creating and customizing the look and feel of WaveMaker applications is just a few clicks away now. We have introduced a theme building tool for changing color schemes and creating branding specs. Theme-builder brings the benefit of codeless theme creation in simple steps. With a built-in code editor, one can make changes and see custom styles instantly applied to the web components.

A theme is a preset package containing graphical appearance details. It is often used to change the look and feel of a wide range of things at once, which makes the elements less granular than allowing the user to set each option individually. For example, You might want to change the  highlighted colors for your project.

## Customize color, typography, and style

To begin customizing a theme, one can modify values for color, typography, and style. By default, the preview application starts with the material theme applied. We can switch between different theme styles and instantly preview the changes.

### Color

To change your theme colors, replace the predefined #HEX color code with a custom color.

Primary color maps to all components and elements, while secondary color accents the icon colors for date and time selection. Background color applies to the scrollable content, while the text color maps to the body text and captions used in the application. 

"Header" and "Left nav" colors define the coloring scheme for background, text, and active links. We also have "More" options to handle the notification and disable state colors.

### Style

Applying different styles like Flat/Material/Gradient will help you understand how the components change. Each selection will override the existing behaviour of the elements displayed in the preview section.

The flat-theme includes a solid background to the elements with active states. It also adds an outlined border for user inputs. 

The material-theme has a sleek finish with elevated shadows to understand each element's relative importance and focus their attention. 

The gradient theme fills the content blocks with a linear gradient shade starting from top to bottom.
